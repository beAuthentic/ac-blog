Recovering from the pandemic means recognizing the new problems it has created, including lonliness.
<!--more-->

Loneliness has been an issue during the pandemic, with people staying at home without opportunities for social contact. Even as restrictions lift and people get back together, there are still those who choose not to, from lingering symptoms to loneliness. Fear of Covid combined with social disconnection have caused both emotional and physical problems, such as less effective vaccines. Humans need connections, and when this need is left unfulfilled, it may lead to more serious problems. As we recover from the pandemic, we should take time to reach out to those whom we may have lost contact with to prevent the spread of loneliness.
