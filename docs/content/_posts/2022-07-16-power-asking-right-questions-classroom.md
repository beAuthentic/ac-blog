### Start classes with open ended personal questions ###
There are two types of questions; general and content questions. Questions like “How do you feel right now?” or “How late is too late of a dinner?” are considered general questions. These questions can build a framework for class engagement. While it's essential to ask questions about the material being covered, approaching it abruptly might be intimidating for students who are shy or afraid of speaking up. It is important to prime the students with general personal questions so that they lower their barriers of speaking up in public. This helps them practice articulating their answers for content related questions later on. In addition, students will be able to retain more information from their peers.

### Let natural conversations build from questions ###
While asking questions is important, how educators ask them is another factor to consider. No one wants to answer too vague or too complex questions. Making sure the questions are [effective] is ideal to encourage continuing conversations. Other students can tune in and build [interpersonal] bonds based on similar responses, therefore increasing engagement in the classroom. Students should feel that they are having time to bond and learn about their peers through conversational responses. There are platforms to support questions in classrooms.

### Open more ways to accept questions ###
Questions are a two way street. It's not always necessary for educators to present the questions. Techniques like group discussions, synchronous online interactions, and allowing students formulate their own questions will all improve classroom engagement. With these activities, students can pose a variety of different [perspective] answers. These activities can be hosted on numerous platforms or even the traditional way without technology. Regardless, it will spark [meaningful] classroom discussion and adhere to engagement.

In a classroom setting where participation, listening, and communication are fundamental to the structure of classes, student relationships with their peers play a significant role in engagement.

### What better way to uphold these principles than to pose questions and encourage student participation? ###
