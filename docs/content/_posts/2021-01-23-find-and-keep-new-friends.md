Connecting and staying connected after the pandemic.
<!--more-->

Our social circles have been disrupted by the pandemic over the past few years. People have lost many friends, and have not had chances to reconnect or make new connections. In order to “find and keep new friends,” the first step is to reconnect with those who have lost contact. Connect with people through shared hobbies and interests, like a club or volunteer opportunity. Then, stay connected. Schedule meet-ups, keep in touch, and most importantly, keep it consistent. Find the time to invest into new friendships and care for existing ones. The times of loneliness and isolation during the pandemic may make this hard for some. As long as you are “being intentional, being available, being reliable and being excited,” you should be able to make new connections and grow them well.
