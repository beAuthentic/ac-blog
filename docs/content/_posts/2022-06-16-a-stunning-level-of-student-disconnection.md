The Chronicle invited faculty members to talk about their exposure to student disengagement. Over 100 people responded, expressing concern for the vast number of unengaged students.

COVID has severely limited the amount of interaction that students had in class so much that it's become an expectation for many to not even try to talk to peers.
Many students waiting for the end of virtual "learning" found themselves severely disappointed when the "normal" they expected was not found.
