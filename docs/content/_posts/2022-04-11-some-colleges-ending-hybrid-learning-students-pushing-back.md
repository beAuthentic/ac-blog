The height of the pandemic brought virtually all schools online, in accordance with Covid protocols. Now, as the rules loosen, different institutions have differing stances on returning to campus, which students have a lot to say about. Many schools require students to return to the classroom, as they value the interaction within the classroom. It often leads to more engaging, better-retained lessons. However, many students have opposed strict in-person requirements because it reduces flexibility and accessibility. Whether it be due to Covid-related reasons or personal conflicts, many students prefer the convenience of online classes. Schools that support online classes look for ways to improve online classes so that it can still offer a good learning experience for their students.
