Connecting and building a friendship is an important aspect of life, and this article reveals tips for educators to establish a bond in doing so.
<!--more-->

Students find it difficult to make friends in person at school. Students frequently turn to their phones to appear busy in an effort to hide any social anxiety they may undergo. While it may be easier for those who are outgoing, skills for making new friends don't come naturally for most people. If the school does not actively encourage students to make friends, they will likely fail. Although friends come and go, friendships have a significant [impact] on a student's relationships and mental health. 

Additionally, friendships are important in the workplace too. In a recent New York Times [article], “at her earlier work, Ms. Degliantoni developed friendships that influenced not only her career but also her sense of self.” Friendships can go a long way. Tech companies are using the desire for connections to generate addictive behaviors to user-generated content, which tends to increase loneliness. Even with advanced education and promising careers, humans feel lonely when we don't have friends. 

Nevertheless, educators can support the foundation of friendships using these methods during the most socially active time of their students' lives; school. This is a new role educators need to adapt to. 

## Bring forth self introductions and questions. 
Educators frequently rely on first-day introductions to get to know one another throughout K-12 grade school. As time went on in college and job interviews were more frequent, the value of self introductions faded. Educators can reestablish self introductions to [engage] students who hinder themselves from social anxiety. Self introductions open individuals up to meeting new people and exhibits confidence that they are willing to make bonds. Educators can establish short presentations on Prezi or video recordings on Flipgrid. 

As a college student, most of my professors do not hinder students from using our phones during class.  It has become impossible to regulate the pervasive usage of phones and laptops during class.  But the problem is the lost opportunity to connect with my classmates.  Whenever there is silence, I find myself picking up my phone. Students develop the undesirable habit of doing so for other classes as a result. 

Encouraging open questions will spark conversations that will break the silence, create bonds, and build a friendship. When educators ask, it gives an opportunity for students to express themselves. Asking questions can be facilitated with the usage of AskClass. Self introductions and question asking pushes students to speak. Speaking up is an interactive way to connect one another. The more students speak, the more they will understand each other therefore, a chance to create a friendship. 

## Encourage connections outside of class. 
Enable students to connect their online profiles, clubs, and other friendship-building activities outside the classroom environment. By doing this, they can ensure that their relationship endures long after the classroom has ended. [Statistics] show that two-thirds of teens share their social media to new friends in order to stay connected. Even while social media is a useful tool for keeping in touch, having lunch together also fosters relationships. It allows for conversations between students and educators that they otherwise wouldn't have in the classroom. Personal connections are created through these social gatherings. 

Students can make friends in a variety of ways. They will appreciate the connections they make courtesy to the effort of the educator. Even while social media is still a popular way to meet people, face-to-face interactions are an iconic approach. Social media is great for keeping in touch, but teachers and students can look to the suggested methods to forge closer bonds with one another.
