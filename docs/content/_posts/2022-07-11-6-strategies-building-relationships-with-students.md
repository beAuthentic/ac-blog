1. Learn names quickly and correctly

   A name is part of one's identity and learning a student's name quickly can leave a good impression.

   Getting names correctly shows that the teachers value and respect the students.

   NEVER give a nickname to a student, UNLESS they prefer that.

   NEVER give call your student by their students' numbers, UNLESS they prefer that.

2. Get to know your students

   > Create an environment that allows students to represent themselves through their culture and hobby.

3. Present student's work

   > Show the classroom a few of students' best works to make the students feel their works are appreciated.

   > This practice also motivates and encourages students to work harder.

4. Change seats often

   > Create an opportunity that allows students to interact and collaborate with different classmates.

5. Find a way to connection
