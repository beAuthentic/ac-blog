In the pandemic era, online learning grew tremendously as schools were forced to adopt it. With this came problems rooted in the digital divide, such as students not having adequate resources to “get to” class or turn in assignments. In some cases, even teachers and educators did not have resources. In other aspects, such as support services, going online helped students access and use them more easily, as they could have easier access to them.

Flexibility in online learning was favored by some students, especially those who had other responsibilities, while others preferred face-to-face options.
