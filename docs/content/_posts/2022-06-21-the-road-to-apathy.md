How we got here and how we move forward.

“You become what you behold.” 
 William Blake


# Setting the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Socrates once said, “The unexamined life is not worth living”. This was in response to being accused of corrupting the youth. The philosophers of old held a sentiment that the goal of education was to produce what was referred to as a “philosopher king”. This idea has since died out in favor of what is commonly known as the factory model of education. The underlying philosophy of our current education seeks to produce a product that is specified by society. 
<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent example of this would be after 2008 when schools were urged to push STEM programs. For those unfamiliar with the term, STEM stands for “Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics”. This led to the majority of schools to push for these “hard science” subjects, in doing so, the subjects of art, philosophy, and many of the liberal arts programs were pushed aside or even cut entirely. The result of this is a devaluing of expression and a negative impact on humans. 

# Unforeseen consequences
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dramatic decline in the studies of the arts shows an underlying assumption that has developed about the human condition: to be human is nothing more than an evolutionary machine set on success in whatever environment is presented to an individual organism. This sentiment has led to a perception that only what can be documented on a resume is worth one’s time.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has only been exacerbated by the pandemic and the shift to remote learning. Media and pop culture give an insight as to what a society values, and if we observe the media of the past decade or so there is a trend of glorifying the hyper intelligent, the cold and calculating, and those with a stringent endeavor to pursue the purely utilitarian vocations and studies.(The Imitation Game, Sherlock Holmes, The Theory of Everything, The Social Network). The result of these pursuits reduces a student to nothing more than a commodity.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irony of this pursuit is that in attempting to create the next DaVinci, Newton, or Einstein, we have inadvertently ensured that any student with the potential is handicapped by a lack of creativity and expression. 

# Light at the end of a tunnel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this article is not to increase the apathetic sentiment or nihilism, quite the opposite. There has been incredibly strong push back from students and teachers alike. Students are advocating for themselves and showing a strong desire to be seen as more than just a resume. Teachers are advocating for ways to engage students for the purpose of making a meaningful impact in students lives. The role of teachers in the last couple of decades has begun to shift, they are no longer a transmitter for information, standing in front of the class and disseminating information, “DNA stands for DeoxyriboNucleic Acid”.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since most information can be transmitted over the internet in the form of youtube, wikipedia, and google searches, the role of teachers is now to step in and become the stewards of creativity. The process and methods of this endeavor will be tabled for a later article. Nonetheless the point still stands. Teachers and students are pushing back and declaring and demanding engagement and connection. Here at AskClass we seek to remove as many barriers as possible so that you as the teacher can feel like you are actually getting to engage and see growth in your students. For the students we seek to help your teachers become more than a face on your laptop. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All it takes for a student to become something more is a mentor that guides and stewards their pursuit of life. This isn’t wishful thinking. This is what separates a youtube video from a teacher. As Mark Van Doren said, “The art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery”.
