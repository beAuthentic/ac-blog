This article reveals educational tools that should be used in the 21st century as an enhancement to the traditional style of teaching.
<!--more-->

Digital platforms are enhancing old traditional teachings in the 21st century. Schools are now enhancing traditional teaching methods with a vast amount of digital technologies to promote engagement. Paper and pencil just doesn’t suit it for students anymore. Nowadays, students tend to rely on laptops and phones for class work. This article reveals the transition of traditional teachings to modern educational tools and how to apply them appropriately. Educators can refer to these existing platforms to continue student’s studies.

### Discussions can be more interactive than just texts.
The first day of classes is an [opportunity] for educators to incorporate [Flipgrid] into creating an introduction. Rather than writing on paper or even typing texts on online discussion boards, Flipgrid allows students to view each other's facial expressions giving a more interactive feel. One of my teachers at San Jose State University assigned book reports that students had to submit using Flipgrid. Students shared their reports through webcam recordings allowing other respondents to also do the same.

### Asking questions to build bonds.
As part of an important aspect of teaching, asking questions will help students articulate their thoughts and ideas. There should be breaks where questions can be asked in between the teaching and learning processes. Just open-ended questions are acceptable; the questions don't have to relate to the lesson. [AskClass] makes it simpler for educators to ask questions and get answers without the hassle of writing on paper. Through the platform’s variety of questions already set, educators can start asking with ease.

### Learn about one another.
Students will learn more about their classmates through the AskClass responses, which promotes interaction. As a result, relationships are formed, providing students a purpose to come to class. As students submit their replies, others can relate to them by finding similar thoughts and interests. Nevertheless, AskClass offers games like This or That and True or False to help people get to know one another. Before class begins, one of my professors makes this activity available so that students can have some fun.

### Choosing new participants.
In every class, there are the students who continuously volunteer while the majority stray from participating. Educators may single them out to answer questions; however, those students might think they're being targeted. A Random Person Selector feature that AskClass provides helps teachers choose students to participate. Random Person Selector allows all students the opportunity to speak without feeling targeted. 

### Have meetings from the convenience of home.
Throughout the pandemic, the majority of schools worldwide transitioned to remote learning. Educators hosted classes on Zoom and students joined with a click of a button. The online phase of communications revealed convenience that people now realize. Educators can establish office hours through Zoom to talk to students. With the various time frames, this will make it easier for students to access these services. Students can join from their portable devices. Furthermore, students can host their own meetings for group based work. This tool in conjunction with educator’s teachings enhances student collaboration. Students can minimize the time needed to meet in person.

With students now returning to in person classes for the first time since the pandemic, a reevaluation of tech tools should be considered. These tools that have been in usage during the pandemic have proven to be effective in student engagement and learning success. Educators are encouraged to blend standard teaching methods and incorporate innovative practices. As early as kindergarten and into the college years, these modern educational tools will raise the standard of teaching, guiding schools to adapt to new ways. Of course, schools shouldn’t entirely rely on tools to exhibit academic learning; rather, they are here to support the traditional ways.
