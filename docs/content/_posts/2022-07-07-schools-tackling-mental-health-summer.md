Schools are offering students mental health support during summer school by incorporating social-emotional learning in addition to academic learning. Almost 30 of the largest U.S. school districts are using Covid-19 rescue funds to add social-emotional support for students within their summer school programs. This has been implemented to address the mental health issues that have arisen during the pandemic.
