College education's percieved value is dropping compared to the past few years.
<!--more-->

“The share of Americans who believe colleges and universities have a positive impact on the country has dropped by 14 percentage points since 2020.” This is according to the most recent results of an annual survey conducted by New America, a nonpartisan think tank. The data has been stable over time, indicating that post-secondary education is generally seen as a good return on investment. However, there has been a drop in how people see higher education’s impact. The survey finds that Democrats and Republicans have different views of higher education, including its positive impact on the country (73% of Democrats and 37% Republicans feel that it is positive), and who should pay for higher education (77% of Democrats and 37% of Republicans say the government should fund higher education). However, over half  of the Americans surveyed, regardless of political standings, think getting American education after high school is hard to afford.
