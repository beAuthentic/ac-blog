As colleges and in-person opportunities open up again, students value connections with those around them even higher.

Students may not initiate these connections, but once faculty encourage student engagement, advising students, and casual activities, students will more eagerly open up to new opportunities, take up challenges, and maintain relationships with their faculty and peers. Virtual appointments can be a great place to start, as it is less intimidating for students than to walk into a professorâ€™s classroom. Understanding that students have trouble starting interactions with teachers, and reaching out to them first, either through casual outings, online meetings, or games in-class can help faculty get to know their students.
